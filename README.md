# Cities of the world demo app
The app was created in dart-flutter because i had some issues with the computer where i work with swift, if you could gime me some extra days i could create the app in also swift 

## Getting Started


To explain better how i build the project i created a video.
The video provides an overview of the main concepts that i used to create the app.

## Run the project

To run the project on your pc/mac, you need to have xcode or android simulator, the flutter sdk and vscode. In vs code you need to have the flutter and dart extension then clone the repository and execute the flutter packages get command in the terminal or click in the button inside of the pubspec.yaml file (like the images show).

- [packages get command](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUo6-P0x51wEyKVkHQoqP-9YJshiAcvI/view?usp=sharing)

_Note: if you are running in mac you will maybe need to change the version of flutter_svg to 0.17.0 or 0.16.0(in pubspec.yaml file) because of  incompatibility then restart vscode_


I let you a link to download the apk in case that you have an android and want to test the app in a real device
